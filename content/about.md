I am *Liv*, the lover of all things language and luxury, books and beauty, reading and rouge. I am smitten with Hazelnut Macchiatos and sipping them throughout the early morning. I love the feeling of acrylic nails tapping on a table top. I live in heels and love the extra confidence boost; the height boost isn't bad either. I am a teacher-to-be and my goal is to be the most fashionable one out there. I have a desire to show people that beauty and brains do go together like peanut butter and jelly, macaroni and cheese, lipliner and bold red lipstick.
